# TikTok Claims Classification – Advanced Data Analytics Project

This repository contains a hands-on data analytics and machine learning project completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** course on **Coursera**.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** to classify user-submitted claims on **TikTok**. As part of the process, I conduct data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and model building.

In one stage of the project, I focus on **hypothesis testing** to examine the relationship between `verified_status` and `video_view_count` to determine whether verification influences a video's visibility.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze and clean real-world TikTok user data
- Explore the relationship between verification status and video performance
- Apply statistical methods such as hypothesis testing
- Build predictive models to classify claims
- Generate clear, well-documented reports for each analysis phase

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structured data exploration and hypothesis formation
- Hypothesis testing using t-tests and ANOVA
- Regression and classification modeling
- Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques
- Interpreting and communicating analytical findings

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: for code, analysis, and visualizations
- **Statistical Methods**: Hypothesis testing (t-tests), correlation, EDA
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, classification
- **Documentation**: Written reports for each section

## 📂 Project Structure

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a phase in the data analytics workflow:

- **`Classifying videos using machine learning`**: Trains and evaluates classification models on TikTok data.
- **`Data exploration and hypothesis testing`**: Tests the hypothesis between verification status and view count.
- **`EDA`**: Visualizes and explores data distributions and relationships.
- **`Inspect and analyze data`**: Performs initial data inspection, cleaning, and transformation.
- **`Regression modeling`**: Builds models to predict continuous outcomes like video views.

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Code (in Jupyter notebooks)
- 📄 A report summarizing findings, techniques, and outcomes

## 📄 Reports

Each section includes a detailed report covering:
- Purpose of analysis
- Methodology used
- Visualizations and test results
- Key insights and next steps
